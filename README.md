# Math Library Documentation
This document provides an overview of a mathematical library developed using the C++17 standard with the Clang compiler. The library is designed as a static library, offering a range of mathematical operations and operator overloads. It also includes comprehensive unit testing coverage using the Google Test (GTest) framework. Additionally, a Makefile is supplied for ease of building both the library and its associated tests.
## Features
- Mathematical Operations: The library implements various mathematical functions, providing a robust toolkit for numerical computations.
- Operator Overloading: Custom operator overloads enhance usability and integrate seamlessly with standard C++ operations.
- Unit Testing: Full coverage of library functions through unit tests ensures reliability and facilitates maintenance.
- Makefile Support: Simplifies the build process with predefined targets such as all, clean, and test.
## Getting Started
To get started with this library, ensure you have the Clang compiler installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
### Prerequisites
- Clang Compiler (C++17 support)
- Google Test framework
- Make utility
### Installation
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
1. Run make to compile the library and tests.
## Usage
Include the library header in your C++ file to access its functionalities.
